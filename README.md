<h1>Open Source Coffee Maker</h1>

Goal: To produce a basic, low cost, single cup coffee maker.

Requirements:

* Must be compatible with off the shelf coffee filters
* Must be able to make a single cup (20 oz) of coffee
  * Minimum 20 oz resevoir
  * Must be able to fit various sizes of mug under the spout
* Must be safe
  * Over voltage protection
  * Over temperature prevention
  * Food grade plastics
* Should be less expensive than other products
  * Not 100% required but the purpose of DIY is to save money so
  * Goal is to be less than $25, the cheapest similar product I can find on Amazon
  
<h1>Parts List</h1>
  
Currently, no hardware plans are finalized. However, this parts list captures components that may be used (i.e. this is a place for me to store a list of parts I plan to use).
* LM317 Linear Voltage Regulator (~$1)
* SRD-05VDC-SL-C Relay (?) (need to confirm part number; check electrical schematic)
* FIT0845 PTC Heating Element (?) (need to decide if this is the exact element I want to use, PTC seems like a good option though)
